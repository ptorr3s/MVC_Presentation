MVC_Presentation
================

How to use this repo:

- Open Visual Studio 2012 Express and double click the Presentation.html file
- Open the Presentation.html file in your favorite browser with ctrl+shift+w (I only used chrome...)

Steps to make the links in the Presentation.html file change your branch:

- Put this code under C:\www\MVC_Presentation *or* edit the runapp.reg file and update the path within.
- Double click said runapp.reg file.
- In Cygwin, run: ./fixbranches.sh

Enjoy. :)
